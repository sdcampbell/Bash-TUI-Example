# Bash-TUI-Example
A starter package for a shell text user interface (TUI) menu. Helpful for occasions where you have a long list of complex commands or want to create a menu of commands so the user simply picks commands to run. Provides the option for the user to enter command variables before running the command, as well as custom commands.

Works on both Bash and Zsh shells on Linux and MacOS.

## Prerequisites

## Demo

In this demo, I've used this project to wrap 47 AWS cli commands. This allows them to be easily organized, searched, update variables, and run or copy the resulting command to the clipboard.
